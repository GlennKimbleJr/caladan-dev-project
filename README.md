## TeachBoost Coach Dev Project

This project is a simple Laravel, Vue, and Inertia application that consists of a single page displaying a list of seeded Teachers. We want to test the ability to make common incremental improvements to the application using the same technology stack as our TeachBoost Coach product.

## Setup

- Close this repository as a normal Laravel application.
- Create your database, then migrate, and seed your application.
- Install and compile your npm assets.
